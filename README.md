# Customer-Segmentation-Recommendation-System
This project analyzes a UK retailer's transactional dataset from 2010-2011 to enhance marketing strategies and boost sales. By applying K-means clustering for customer segmentation, we aim to create a customer-centric dataset. Additionally, we will develop a recommendation system to suggest top-selling products to each segment.
